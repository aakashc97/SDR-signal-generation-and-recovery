# SDR-signal-generation-and-recovery

This repository is used to generate DAC signals with a method called Signal Defined Radio using libiio. The platform used for the project is a Xilinx FPGA vcu118 and Analog Devices DAC/ADC AD9081. The bit_generation.c compiled on the host machine will generate a bitstream which the DAC_streaming.c code will use to generate samples using the DAC. There is also a Clock Data Recovery code which will help extract the samples generated by the DAC and captured by an oscilloscope. The DAC_streaming.c is cross-compiled for the microblaze softprocessor using microblaze gcc in Xilinx SDK 2019.1.
